 *
 * Class: Evaluator
 *
 * This class is responsible for evaluating chessboard states using a machine learning model.
 * It integrates with a neural network to estimate the value of a position and the probability
 * distribution over legal moves, helping to guide the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) process.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Accepting chessboard states and encoding them into input formats for the neural network.
 * - Interfacing with a neural network to predict position evaluation and move probabilities.
 * - Returning evaluation results in a format usable by MCTS or other decision-making algorithms.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - `NeuralNetworkInterface` for communication with the neural network.
 * - `ChessBoard` for handling chessboard states.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate an `Evaluator` object.
 * - Use `evaluateBoard` to compute the value and move probabilities for a given board state.
 * - Feed the results into MCTS or other search algorithms.
