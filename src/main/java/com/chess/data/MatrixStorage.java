 * Class: MatrixStorage
 *
 * This class provides functionality for storing, retrieving, and managing numerical matrices
 * used in chess analysis. It ensures efficient access and manipulation of data for evaluations
 * or neural network processing.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Storing matrices representing evaluations, probabilities, or board positions.
 * - Efficiently retrieving specific data slices or subsets.
 * - Persisting matrix data to files or databases for long-term storage.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - Data structures for storing matrices (e.g., 2D arrays, lists).
 * - File I/O utilities for saving and loading data.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate a `MatrixStorage` object.
 * - Use `saveMatrix` to store a numerical matrix persistently.
 * - Use `loadMatrix` to retrieve saved matrices for analysis or visualization.
