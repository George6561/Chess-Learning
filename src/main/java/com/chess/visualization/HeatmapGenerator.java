 * Class: HeatmapGenerator
 *
 * This class generates visual heatmaps to represent chessboard data, such as move probabilities,
 * positional evaluations, or neural network activations. The heatmaps can overlay directly onto
 * the chessboard for easy interpretation.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Generating heatmaps based on numerical values for each square on the chessboard.
 * - Applying customizable color gradients to highlight critical areas.
 * - Supporting integration with graphical interfaces for dynamic display.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - `ChessBoard` for accessing the chessboard layout and data.
 * - Java graphical libraries (e.g., AWT, Swing, JavaFX) for rendering images.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate a `HeatmapGenerator` object.
 * - Use `createHeatmap` to generate a heatmap from an evaluation matrix.
 * - Overlay the heatmap onto a chessboard image or export it as an independent graphic.
