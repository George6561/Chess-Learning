 * Class: MatrixImageGenerator
 *
 * This class converts 2D numerical matrices into graphical images, such as grids or heatmaps.
 * It is designed to visualize data generated during chess analysis, such as probability distributions
 * or evaluation scores.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Rendering images from 2D arrays of numerical data.
 * - Applying color gradients to represent different value ranges.
 * - Exporting images in common formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG) for external analysis.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - Java graphical libraries (e.g., AWT, JavaFX) for image manipulation.
 * - File I/O utilities for saving the generated images.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate a `MatrixImageGenerator` object.
 * - Use `renderMatrixAsImage` to generate an image from a 2D matrix.
 * - Save or display the generated image as part of your visualization pipeline.
