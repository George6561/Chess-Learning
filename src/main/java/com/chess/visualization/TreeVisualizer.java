 *
 * Class: TreeVisualizer
 *
 * This class visualizes the structure of a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) tree. It provides
 * tools for rendering nodes, edges, and statistics, offering insights into the decision-making
 * process during gameplay.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Drawing tree structures to represent MCTS nodes and their connections.
 * - Highlighting the most visited or promising paths based on simulation data.
 * - Integrating with graphical frameworks for interactive visualization.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - `MonteCarloNode` and `Tree` for accessing the tree structure and node data.
 * - Graphical libraries (e.g., Swing, JavaFX) for rendering the visualization.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate a `TreeVisualizer` object.
 * - Use `drawTree` to render the MCTS tree starting from the root node.
 * - Customize node and edge appearances using provided settings.
