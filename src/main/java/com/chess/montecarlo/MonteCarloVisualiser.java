 * Class: MonteCarloVisualiser
 *
 * This class provides tools for visualizing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) process.
 * It displays the structure of the search tree, including nodes, moves, and simulation statistics,
 * allowing users to better understand and debug the MCTS algorithm.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Generating graphical representations of the MCTS tree.
 * - Displaying node statistics such as visit counts and win rates.
 * - Highlighting the most promising paths based on UCT values or visit counts.
 * - Interfacing with GUI frameworks for visual output (e.g., JavaFX or Swing).
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - `MonteCarloNode` for accessing tree structure and node statistics.
 * - `ChessBoard` for displaying board states corresponding to tree nodes.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate a `MonteCarloVisualiser` object.
 * - Use `displayTree` to render the MCTS tree and statistics.
 * - Call `highlightBestPath` to show the most promising moves based on simulation results.
