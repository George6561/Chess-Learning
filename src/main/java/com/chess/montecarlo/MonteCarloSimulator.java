 * Class: MonteCarloSimulator
 *
 * This class performs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) simulations for decision-making in chess.
 * It uses a tree structure to evaluate moves by simulating random playouts and updating node
 * statistics to determine the most promising paths.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Running simulations from a given node to expand and evaluate game states.
 * - Calculating UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees) values to balance exploration and exploitation.
 * - Performing random playouts to simulate potential game outcomes.
 * - Backpropagating results to update node statistics.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - `MonteCarloNode` for representing individual board states and statistics in the tree.
 * - `ChessBoard` for handling chessboard states during simulations.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Instantiate a `MonteCarloSimulator` object.
 * - Use `simulate` to perform a simulation from a given root node.
 * - Retrieve the best move using `selectBestMove` based on simulation results.
